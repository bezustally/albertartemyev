		"en": "Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He lived in a village, in a non-prosperous family, he lived and loved music very much. He loved it so-o much that he was seeing it at night, almost every night. And he had a dream ‚Äì to become a musician, a real musician..<br><br>In the village where he lived was a club. There were different groups of self-activity in which children were engaged in that club. In Soviet times, these groups, as a rule, were free of charge. In addition to clubs like <em>‚ÄúCutting and sewing‚Äù</em>, there was a group of Guitarists in this club, where the artistic director taught the basics of playing the guitar.<br><br>And so he and his mother came to this local club. The artistic director pressed some keys on the old piano and asked the boy about something. Boy answered at random ... At the end of all this there was a finale ‚Äî <em>‚ÄúThe boy has no ear for music!‚Äù</em><br><br>Many years later, the Chief Conductor of a large symphony orchestra will say heatedly: ‚Äî <em>‚ÄúAnd why the hell did I study at the Conservatories, if a person without education can compose like THAT!‚Äù</em> And offer him to write a rock opera! And a rock opera will be written, only they will not be able to find money for its production! And he will also explain to this boy that he hears music differently than everyone else.., he sees its colors, and this is a rarity. But that will be much later.<br><br>But thereat, the fact that he does not have an ear for music sounded like a bolt from the blue .., like a Sentence! Which was not subject to appeal!<br><br>Mom didn‚Äôt care: one less concern, but the boy was very worried about it all..., he suffered ... and in the end he decided this: <em>‚ÄúEven if I don‚Äôt have an ear for music, but everyone has a sense of rhythm, I‚Äôll just play the guitar, rearranging chords to the beat.‚Äù</em> And he started saving up for a guitar. The money that he was sometimes given for lunch at school, he put aside...<br><br>Time passed... and the day came when a miracle happened and he bought a guitar! <small>(manufactured by a local Furniture Factory üòä)</small>  When the boy brought it home from the store, he was condemned, but he did not hear anyone, he admired her like an Ikon!<br><br>Learning to play the guitar was not easy at all. When he asked one of his peers to show something, everyone laughed, because in the village everyone knows everything about everyone and everyone knew about his lack of hearing. But this did not upset him very much, because he had already come to terms with this and the bar of his dreams was lowered. In the evenings, he came to the rehearsals of a local band and quietly sketched the position of the fingers on the guitar fretboard in a notebook.<br><br>Then one of the peers descended and showed some elementary positions and techniques. Excruciating workdays began ... Coming from school at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, he sat down with a guitar and sat until 12 at night, sometimes even fell asleep with it ... There were bruises and blood calluses on his fingers, But this is such nonsense .. HE PLAYED THE GUITAR ... !! !<br><br>A few months later, he was already more or less oriented in chords and could quite tolerably play some kind of courtyard song üòä The boy was in seventh heaven with joy ‚Äì sounds were born from under his fingers! A little clumsy, but played by them! It was here that they began at school, instead of textbooks, notes appeared on the desk. Notes are a whole world of Magic and Wizardry. And the boy is trying to comprehend this world, trying to unravel the secret of creating harmonies and he will succeed, because there is a whole life ahead !!!<br><br>As time went on.., thanks to hard work, he already played the guitar with chords quite tolerably, but his dream was to play in a <em>‚Äúlive‚Äù</em> band. 3 rock bands were playing at the local club at that time. The boy noticed that there were many guitarists who wanted to get there, but few people can play the synthesizer, and he decides to learn how to play the synthesizer. But how, how can you learn to play the synthesizer yourself??? The boy's mind was always inquisitive, which means that he always tried to understand the essence and he succeeded. Taking a pen and a notebook in his hands, he painted the structure of chords according to the notes and transferred them to white and black keys. It was SO SIMPLE üòä <small>(only later did he find out that this is taught in the last year of the Music College)</small> Having drawn the keys of the synthesizer on a regular board and having practiced for several weeks, he mastered the basics of playing the keyboard <small>(later, using this technique, he will teach others in a short time)</small> So , somehow, with a creak, he was taken to the second <small>(reserve)</small> set of the local band. With a strict condition: Play only chords and NO solo parts!<br><br>But rules are there to be broken:<br><br>It was happiness! Happiness exists, it cannot but be! The boy came to the rehearsal an hour before the appointed time, connected the synthesizer and played. He was a member of the holy of holies ‚Äì the Club ... Happiness overwhelmed the soul. It is difficult now to remember what and how, but after half a year he played in all 3 teams. On synth in one, on drums in another, and on a bass-guitar in third. Moreover, some musicians sometimes asked him to show them some tricks üòä. Despite all these small achievements, the boy was sure that he still did not have a hearing, but they didn‚Äôt let him near the microphone yet: Oh, but it would be time already üòä It took a lot of work to persuade the artistic director to learn with him one of the songs of <em>‚ÄúTime Machine‚Äú</em> band. It turned out that singing is as difficult as playing, and maybe even more difficult. After a couple of months, the song was learned and sung at a disco. No one seemed to be sick, and that's okay üòä<br><br>The boy was already in high school when he realized that you can learn to play the guitar yourself, but only at an elementary, primitive level, and in order to grow further, you need a teacher.<br><br>The boy was desperate by nature, I am surprised by him even now. He was not afraid of anything. Difficulties, hardships, distances did not matter to him. On the contrary, he seemed to be <em>looking for them</em>. The village in which he lived was located on the banks of the Volga River, 15 kilometers from the nearest provincial town, and even then that town was on the other side of the Volga. In the summer, small ships went back and forth and served as shuttle buses, transporting people. In winter, in order to get to the city, it was necessary to cross the frozen river on ice, and it is about 2 kilometers wide, then walk 8 kilometers through the forest and go out onto the highway to catch a ride.<br><br>And so the boy goes to the city and enrolls in a club of guitarists at some kind of House of Culture. Classes were held twice a week, Tuesday and Friday, you can not miss. The teacher of the club treated the boy with respect when he found out about his place of residence and played him several compositions that he would teach him to play. Heart was ready to jump out of chest! <em>‚ÄùCan not be! Can I really play like that, or at least something like that!‚Äú</em> When he returned home, no one in the class believed that SUCH a thing was possible. But how will he combine everything, lessons at school and classes in a guitar club? But the boy was sure ‚Äì <em>‚ÄùNonsence, we'll break through !!!‚Äú</em><br><br>Teachers at school did not like him well, because the family in which he grew up was not prosperous, and in the villages this stigma stretches for a person all his life. No matter how much he crammed the lessons at the beginning, they weren't rating him above B, and he began to cool down to study, rolled down to Cs, because his place was there <small>(After a few years, he will come to this school to work as a teacher and will be horrified by the <em>‚Äùdullness‚Äú</em> of those who taught him)</small>.<br><br>In order to engage in a guitar club, he had to run away from his last lessons at school. In the summer he went there on a steamboat, and when the Volga froze, he crossed it on ice, further through the forest, a highway, a ride, and it's done. Rain, wind and cold were not a hindrance <small>(but a good tempering)</small>.<br><br>When spring came and the ice on the Volga broke, he jumped over this big river on ice floes <small>(Now these memories are chilling my skin).</small> But nothing could happen to him, he was simply sure of it! In the class, there was shock and envy among the students, no one was laughing at him anymore <small>(paying respect, bloody hell)</small>. Only the teachers were furious. How is it? Violation of discipline, well, bring his mother here, and ‚Äùscold‚Äú them both so that others would not be in the habit. Look at him, running away from the lessons! <small>(In that school, they still remember all this and they say that this boy should have been supported, and not obstructed with obstacles. Ehhh ... what did you think before, <em>ladies</em>).</small> Scandal at home .., threats... bans... tightening the screws... To the boy: <em>‚Äì You understand everything... ???</em> Boy:&nbsp<em>‚Äì Yes, I&nbspunderstand everything.</em> But the next day of classes came and he was not at the last lessons. The principal's office, the carpet, more threats, the teachers' council... Nevermind, everything passed by. The principal considered what was happening a personal insult and began to persecute him herself. At break, she stood at the door with an angry air and did not take her eyes off him. He slipped away, bastard ... They took away the briefcase, locked the class .... Don't care... the window, the drainpipe, the steeplechase, the threats behind...<br><br>But over time, somehow, slowly, everyone reconciled and stopped paying attention to this <small>(Get a load of me!)</small>. Even once, when classes at the club were canceled due to the teacher‚Äôs illness and the boy was sitting dejectedly looking out the window at the last lessons from which he was supposed to escape, the teacher sympathetically asked if he was sick and offered to let him go home üòä<br><br>These lessons were not in vain. The workload was great. The teacher showed some exercises and said that it should be played 20 times a day, the boy played it 100 times !!! After all, his peak is very high. Things were moving on...<br><br>By the time he graduated from high school, he already enjoyed some respect among local musicians and even began to try to compose songs himself. The songs, of course, were very weak, but it was something inexplicable and fantastic. For a while you lose your sense of reality and are transported to another world... the world of your fantasies. True, it is very difficult to hone your style in verse and learn to penetrate the soul with a melody, but he believed that he would learn this, no matter what it cost.<br><br>After graduating from school, he is taken to the Army. In the village where he lived, it was not customary to <em>‚Äúhang‚Äù</em> from service, plus no one knew how to do it. He had to go to serve üòä. It's a pity, such a pity to take a break of 2 years, while it was possible to grow well during this time, especially since he was no longer the last person among local musicians.<br><br>Tank troops.., driver.., I won‚Äôt talk much about his service, I don‚Äôt like it üòä. Although this is a fairly long period of life. Let me just say that for 2 years every day he thought about how he would return and continue to play. There were many different guys in the army, getting to know one of them helped him a lot. It was a little clumsy guy named Volodya, Volodya Glukh. He was a muscovite and before the service he studied somewhere at the philological faculty. It was Volodya Glukh who taught the boy the methods of versification, suggested what was possible and what was not possible in writing poetry.<br><br>Upon returning home after the army, much has changed in the village. The people began to leave, who went where ... The head of the club and the artistic director left for the big city, instead of them a former classmate worked, who made a terrible mess in the club üòä. Bands at the club no longer existed, the equipment was broken and smashed. Immediately upon arrival, He gathers a band, with no musicians left in the village, he had to recruit brainy guys and teach them from scratch. It is difficult, of course, but there is no choice. He is hired as the director of the club. Can't believe! Now he is the most important person here. By hook or by crook, he <em>‚Äúbeats out‚Äù</em> money from the administration and buys new equipment. Days and nights he puts the Club in order, on his own, absolutely everything on his own! He paints, washes and repairs. The club is changing dramatically. Lights running around the stage, backlighting, mirror balls... The group he leads is also making progress... In short, after some time their performances are a huge success. A full hall, even from neighboring villages come to listen to them.<br><br>He is also invited to school to work part-time as a labor teacher and military instructor. What else is needed for happiness... Club director..., teacher at school... Just live and rejoice... But no, that's not enough... He knew perfectly well that his peak was much higher. It is difficult to grow further in music if you are the best in this place and everyone you play with is your students... He really missed communication with people who are doing the same thing, with equals. Plus, the mentality in the village was such a.. Once when he was sitting in the teacher's room and filling out a class journal, one elderly teacher asked him <em>‚Äú‚Äì Are you still strumming on the guitar? ‚Äì When will you grow up?..‚Äù</em> All in all, everything gradually went to the point that it was necessary to leave for the big city. It was very difficult to decide on this step, to lose the apartment, position, job, everything: and go nowhere... Into the Unknown... And He ‚Äì makes this Step...<br><br>TO BE CONTINUED.....<br>",
